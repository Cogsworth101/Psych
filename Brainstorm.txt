I guess we could do 3D, but its difficult. Atmosphere wouldn't be too bad though, much easier in 3D I think.

	Genre/Theme:
I think we decided on psychological horror, but we can change it if necessary.
Tapping into specific fears is a good idea, I have a good general list from a podcast I've listened to about a thousand times, Smirkes 14 (now 15), that encompasses pretty much all fears to some extent.

- The Hunt: The player is pursued by an unstoppable entity, creating a sense of urgency and dread.
- The Flesh: Body horror elements, like characters mutating or environments made of flesh.
- The Beholding: The player is constantly watched, and their actions are judged or manipulated by an unseen force.
- The Lonely: Isolation mechanics, where the player is cut off from allies or safe spaces.
- The Stranger: Unsettling doppelgangers or characters who aren’t what they seem.
- The Spiral: Reality itself becomes unreliable, with shifting environments and false memories.
- The Extinction: Themes of apocalypse or the end of humanity, with eerie, abandoned landscapes.
- The Vast: Fear of open spaces, heights, or the infinite, like falling into an endless void.
- The Buried: Claustrophobic environments, like collapsing tunnels or being buried alive.
- The Corruption: Decay, disease, or infestation, both in the environment and characters.
- The Desolation: Fire, destruction, and loss, with a focus on pain and suffering.
- The Web: Manipulation and control, where the player feels like a puppet in a larger scheme.
- The End: Themes of mortality and inevitability, with death as a constant presence.
- The Dark: Fear of the unknown, with light as a precious resource.

This is from deepseek ai, its not final, thats just some basic representations of ideas we could make.

	Basic ideas to throw around/Brainstorming:
Sanity meter, that looks like a health bar (you don't know its a sanity bar), when entities attack you it goes down, but very slowly.
You have a friend maybe that sticks by you and slowly things about them change, like the color of their freckles or their shirt color shifts hues slightly, you barely notice it but it sets you on edge which is the goal of a truly good psychological thriller.
Your friend could also start to talk weird randomly, maybe a weird symbol thrown in, or randomly capitalized letters. And have the text appear like its being typed, then more quickly as the game moves on.

Fear-Based Progression: The player’s actions could influence which fears manifest in the game. For example, if the player avoids light sources, The Dark could become more prominent, altering the environment and gameplay.
Another idea from deepseek, solid play here, I was throwing the idea around earlier, but this gives a solid example^
