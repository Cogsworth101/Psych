Elemental Fusion fast paced multiplayer game
Fire Water Air Earth Electric
- Essentially there are 2 teams of 4, the games are incredibly fast paced.
- There will most likely be 1 of each element type, leading players to specialize their specific element, but forcing them to branch when other players select it first.
Main mechanics are elemental fusion like the TBD title above.

def key - curl into ball
atk key - use an attack or "attack" teammate

Team combo attacks/defenses consume both teammates, inputs are averaged for movement, sometimes slowed.

Fire a + Earth d = Lava (hurts others)
Earth a + Fire d = Bomb (can roll)
Mud + Fire a = Pot
Lava + Water a = Obsidian
Fire a + Bomb = Ignite Bomb (2 second countdown)
Earth n + Air a = Dust Storm (-vis for enemies)
Earth d + Water a = Mud (+hp to team that cast it)

PVP:
- Water a -> Fire_both = -hp
- Earth a -> any_enemy = -hp
- Wind a -> any_enemy (or combo !Bomb) = pushes entity
- Wind a + enemy_bomb = Defuse Bomb
- Earth d+a -> any_teammate = +def
- Air d+a -> Fire_teammate = +speed -def
- Water d+a -> any_teammate = +hp
Bomb_lit_enemy -> Obsidian_team = Fire_team, Water_team, Earth_team (seperates, -hp)


Supers:
Earth + Water (Mud) + Fire (Pot) + Wind = Shatter pot (Super def, all 4) gives 8 buffs anybody can pick up, +hp, +speed, +def
Fire + Earth (Lava) + Water (Obsidian) + Air = Storm (Super atk, all 4)
